Everything related to taking payments, testing transactional flows, and responding to gateway events.

## Contents

- `WORLDPAY_CONFIGURATION.md` – Environment variables, credentials, and dashboard setup steps.
- `WORLDPAY_API_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` – Common sandbox/live issues and how to resolve them.
- `WORLDPAY_WEBHOOK_SETUP.md` – Webhook URL configuration and signature validation notes.

### Usage Tips

- Keep sensitive values (API usernames, passwords) out of checked-in docs—reference environment variable names instead.
- Record any email conversations or sample payloads from Worldpay support in this folder so the whole team can benefit.
- When we move back to the Access Checkout session-based flow, document the request/response schema here.
