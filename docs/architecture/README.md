# Architecture Notes

Use this folder for high-level system design material:

- Application diagrams (frontend, backend, integrations)
- Data models and Prisma schema notes
- ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- Future roadmap ideas and tech debt tracking

If you create diagrams, export them as SVG/PNG and include the source (Excalidraw, Figma, etc.) alongside the rendered asset. Update this README with links whenever you add new references.
