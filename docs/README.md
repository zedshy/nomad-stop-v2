# Nomad Stop Documentation Hub

This directory keeps the project knowledge base organised so that engineers, operators, and stakeholders can quickly find what they need.

## Directory Map

- `architecture/` – Application overview, domain diagrams, and future planning notes.
- `deployment/` – Deployment guides, scripts, infrastructure checklists.
- `payments/` – Worldpay configuration, troubleshooting, webhook setup.
- `operations/` – Restaurant + fulfilment workflows, production SOPs.

Each subfolder contains its own `README.md` plus supporting guides. When you add new documents, keep them grouped by theme so the structure stays predictable.

## Conventions

- Use Markdown for guides (`*.md`). Scripts or configs can live alongside if referenced.
- Prefix multi-step runbooks with verbs, e.g. `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`, `ORDER_FLOW_PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md`.
- Update this file whenever the structure changes.
